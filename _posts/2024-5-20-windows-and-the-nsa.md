title: Windows "Recall" feature is just collecting data for the NSA
---

As a steadfast advocate for privacy and anonymity, the recent announcement from Microsoft CEO Satya Nadella about the new "Recall" feature for Windows PCs is deeply concerning. This feature, set to be introduced in future versions of Windows 10 and beyond, promises to revolutionize productivity by creating a comprehensive photographic memory of all your computer activities through constant screenshots. While this may sound like a technological marvel, the implications for our privacy and freedom are nothing short of alarming.

## What is "Recall"?
Recall is designed to continuously take screenshots of everything you do on your Windows PC, creating a detailed log of your activities. This feature aims to help users by enabling them to revisit any past task, recover lost information, and streamline their workflow. Imagine being able to recall a specific interaction, document, or webpage from a vast timeline of your digital life – it’s like having a personal assistant with an impeccable memory.

## The nightmare.
But let's not be blinded by the allure of convenience. The other side of Recall reveals a chilling reality: your PC becomes a surveillance device, capturing and storing a vast amount of personal data. This data includes everything from sensitive passwords to intimate conversations and financial details. The potential for misuse is staggering, making your computer a prime target for cybercriminals.

Given the historical context of government surveillance programs and data breaches, we have every reason to be wary. Recall could easily become a goldmine for organizations like the NSA, which might seek access to this information through legal or covert means. The notion of every digital action being documented and stored brings us uncomfortably close to an Orwellian reality, where our fundamental right to privacy is under siege.

## Implications for Privacy Advocates
For those who value privacy and anonymity, the introduction of Recall necessitates a serious reevaluation of digital security practices. Here are some critical considerations and potential actions:

- **Increased Data Vulnerability:** With constant screenshotting, more data is stored locally or in the cloud, heightening the risk of data breaches. It’s essential to implement robust security measures, including updated antivirus software, firewalls, and regular system audits.

- **Third-Party Access:** Detailed logs of your activities could be accessible to third parties, including tech companies, hackers, and government agencies. Vigilance is key in managing permissions granted to applications and services.

- **Exploring Alternatives:** Given these concerns, consider transitioning to alternative operating systems that prioritize privacy. Linux distributions, for example, are renowned for their strong security features and open-source transparency.

- **Legal and Ethical Challenges:** The introduction of such comprehensive data logging raises significant legal and ethical issues. Stay informed about your rights and any legislative developments in response to features like Recall.
